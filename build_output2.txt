       1.  Dependency 'and
roidx.core:core:1.16.0' 
requires libraries and 
applications that
           depend on it 
to compile against 
version 35 or later of the
           Android APIs.
     
           :app is 
currently compiled 
against android-34.
     
           Also, the 
maximum recommended 
compile SDK version for 
Android Gradle
           plugin 8.2.1 
is 34.
     
           Recommended 
action: Update this 
project's version of the 
Android Gradle
           plugin to one 
that supports 35, then 
update this project to use
           compileSdk of 
at least 35.
     
           Note that 
updating a library or 
application's compileSdk 
(which
           allows newer 
APIs to be used) can be 
done separately from 
updating
           targetSdk 
(which opts the app in to 
new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which 
determines which devices 
the app can be installed
           on).
     
       2.  Dependency 'and

currently uses Android 
Gradle plugin 8.2.1.
